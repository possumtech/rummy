# AGENTS: Planning & Progress

> "Is there a rummy way to do this?" Every `<tag>` the model sees is a
> plugin. Every scheme is registered by its owner. Every piece of data
> exists as an entry or a column. No exceptions without documentation.

## Current State

Plugin-driven architecture. Instantiated classes, constructor receives
`core` (PluginContext). Registration via `core.on()` / `core.filter()`.
Assembly via `assembly.system` / `assembly.user` filter chains.
No monolithic assembler. Loops table (projects > runs > loops > turns).
160 unit + 92 integration passing. 11/11 e2e. Live tests need rerun.

## Todo: Scheme Registration by Plugins

Schemes are hardcoded in `001_initial_schema.sql`. Each plugin should
register its own scheme via `core.registerScheme()`. PluginContext and
`initPlugins` infrastructure is built. Needs:

- [ ] Add `core.registerScheme()` to every tool plugin constructor
- [ ] Remove hardcoded INSERT from migration (table definition stays)
- [ ] Audit schemes bootstrapped by core in `initPlugins`
- [ ] File scheme (`null` scheme for bare paths) — special case, document why
- [ ] Skill scheme registered by skills plugin
- [ ] http/https schemes registered by file plugin or web plugin

## Todo: TurnExecutor Thinning

TurnExecutor is 600 lines. It directly writes audit entries that should
be owned by plugins:

- [ ] `assistant://N` — audit plugin or dedicated assistant plugin
- [ ] `system://N`, `user://N` — telemetry plugin (already captures via filter)
- [ ] `model://N` — telemetry plugin
- [ ] `reasoning://N` — telemetry plugin
- [ ] `content://N` — telemetry plugin
- [ ] `error://N` — error handling plugin
- [ ] `prompt://N`, `ask://N`, `act://N` — prompt plugin
- [ ] `progress://N` — progress plugin
- [ ] `instructions://system` — instructions plugin

Each becomes a plugin subscribing to turn events. TurnExecutor emits
events at checkpoints, plugins write their own entries.

## Todo: ResponseHealer → Hedberg + Core Handler

ResponseHealer is model slop interpretation (hedbergian) mixed with
state machine decisions (core). Split:

- [ ] Move string/syntax interpretation into hedberg plugin
  - "Is this plain text or commands?"
  - "Does this contain investigation tools?"
  - "Is this a tool-only response with no status?"
- [ ] Keep state machine in core ResponseHandler
  - Continue/stop/heal decisions
  - Stall counter
  - Loop detection
  - Calls hedberg for interpretation, makes decisions itself

## Todo: XmlParser → Hedberg Migration

`resolveCommand` in XmlParser does hedbergian format detection inline.
The format-specific parsers (edits, sed, normalize) already moved to
hedberg. Remaining:

- [ ] Move JSON `{ search, replace }` detection to hedberg
- [ ] Move `value` → `body` healing to hedberg/normalize.js (done)
- [ ] Move unrecognized-attr-as-path healing to hedberg/normalize.js (done)
- [ ] Consider moving `resolveCommand` entirely — it's mostly hedberg
      with tool routing glue

## Todo: Skill Plugin Paradigm Fix

Skills plugin bypasses the entry system — does raw DB writes with
`runRow.next_turn` outside any loop context. A skill is just an entry
with two exceptional qualities: (1) sorted to top of context in the
materialized view, (2) body sourced from `~/.rummy/skills/`. The
client adds skills to a run; they aren't included otherwise. Should
go through normal `store.upsert` like everything else.

- [ ] `skills.js` → `skill.js` (matches scheme name, matches convention)
- [ ] Skill registers its own scheme via `core.registerScheme()`
- [ ] Replace raw DB write with `store.upsert` through proper pipeline

## Todo: File Scheme Special Case

The `null` scheme (bare file paths) has no plugin owner. The file plugin
handles projections and scanning but doesn't own the scheme itself
because bare paths have `scheme IS NULL` in the DB. Document this as
a known exception. The file plugin should register a `file` scheme even
though bare paths use NULL — the view maps NULL to 'file' category.

## Todo: Server-Side Disk Writes for Headless Clients

rummy.nvim writes accepted set patches and rm deletions to disk
before sending resolve. The scanner then picks up changes on the
next turn via mtime+hash. This works for interactive clients.

But headless/API clients (e.g., test harness, future web UI, CI
integration) that call resolve without writing to disk will cause
the scanner to overwrite accepted edits with stale disk content.

The server needs an optional disk write path on resolve/accept:
- [ ] `<set>` accept: write patched content to project_root/path
- [ ] `<rm>` accept: delete project_root/path
- [ ] `<mv>` accept: rename file on disk
- [ ] `<cp>` accept: copy file on disk
- [ ] `<sh>` accept: execute command (already proposed, needs exec)
- [ ] `<env>` accept: execute command (already proposed, needs exec)

This could be a core resolve handler or a plugin that subscribes
to resolution events. The client should be able to opt out (it
handles disk writes itself). Maybe a `diskWrite: true` param on
resolve, or a server config flag.

## Todo: Proposal Lifecycle Refactor

The model sends multiple commands in one response. Some go to proposed
(file-scheme rm, set, sh). The current dispatch executes all commands
regardless of proposal state. The resolve path handles proposals one
at a time. This creates a class of bugs:

- Model sends `<rm>file` + `<summarize>file deleted.` — rm goes to
  proposed, summarize claims success. Currently mitigated by overriding
  summarize when proposals exist, but the model's other commands
  (known, set, etc.) after a proposed entry may also assume the outcome.
- Multiple proposals on same turn are resolved independently by the
  user, but commands between proposals may depend on earlier outcomes.
- When a proposal is rejected, commands that followed it in the
  response may be invalid — but which ones? Not all are dependent.

Needs:
- [ ] Design the ordering semantics: which entries after a proposal
      depend on the proposal's outcome?
- [ ] On rejection, invalidate dependent entries with clear error
- [ ] On acceptance, confirm dependent entries were correct
- [ ] Handle interleaved proposals: `<rm>A`, `<set>B`, `<rm>C` where
      A is rejected but C is accepted
- [ ] Summarize/update from a turn with proposals should always be
      held until all proposals resolve

Current mitigation: TurnExecutor overrides summarize when any entry
on the turn is proposed. This prevents the "model claims success"
bug but doesn't handle dependent tool entries.

## Todo: Native Tool Call Normalization (Hedberg)

Models sometimes emit native tool calling syntax instead of rummy XML:
`<|tool_call>call:search{query:"..."}<tool_call|>` instead of
`<search>...</search>`. The intent is unambiguous — hedberg should
silently translate. This is a preprocessing step in XmlParser.

Needs mapping for the full set of native formats:
- Qwen: `<|tool_call>call:NAME{params}<tool_call|>`
- OpenAI function calling: `{"name":"search","arguments":{"query":"..."}}`
- Anthropic: `<tool_use>` blocks
- Generic: `function_call`, `tool_use`, etc.

Each maps to the corresponding rummy `<NAME>` XML tag. The model tried
to use the right tool — we just translate the format. No warnings,
no feedback. Hedberg doesn't lecture.

## Todo: E2E Web Search Test

The test asserts that a fetched URL has > 200 chars of content, forcing
the model to `<get>` a result URL. But models often answer from search
snippets alone. Either the prompt needs to require information only
available in the full article, or the assertion should validate the
fetch pipeline separately from the model's answering strategy.

## Todo: Model rm Path Training Issue

The model tried `<rm path="unknown://specific aspects of...">` with
literal spaces instead of the encoded URI `unknown://specific%20aspects%20...`.
It referenced the entry by its body text, not its path. Two concerns:
(1) the model never sees encoded paths in context — it sees body text —
so it has no way to know the encoded form. (2) Should `<rm>` accept
body text as a match target? The hedberg pattern matching on the path
won't match unencoded text against encoded paths. May need rm to fall
back to body matching, or expose paths in a model-friendly format.

## Todo: Separate State from Fidelity

The `state` column on known_entries does double duty: lifecycle state
(proposed, pass, rejected, error) and fidelity level (full, summary,
index, stored). These are orthogonal concerns conflated into one field.

The `valid_states` constraint on the schemes table forces tools to
declare which fidelity levels their entries can be at. This is
backwards — the relevance engine should be able to demote any entry
to summary or index without the tool's permission. The tool owns the
content and lifecycle, not the fidelity.

Needs:
- [ ] Separate `state` (lifecycle) from `fidelity` (visibility level)
- [ ] `state`: proposed, pass, rejected, error, active
- [ ] `fidelity`: full, summary, index, stored (managed by relevance)
- [ ] `valid_states` on schemes only constrains lifecycle states
- [ ] v_model_context derives visibility from fidelity, not state
- [ ] Relevance engine can set fidelity on any entry freely

## Todo: Fidelity Ownership

Assembly plugins (previous, current) were hardcoding fidelity when
rendering tool tags. Fixed to use the entry's own fidelity from the
view. But the broader question: who decides fidelity?

- v_model_context assigns fidelity based on state
- Tool plugins register `full` and `summary` views
- Assembly plugins should never override fidelity
- Structural tools (summarize, update) should return identical content
  for both full and summary — they're short by definition

Remaining: audit that all tool plugins register both `full` and
`summary` views, and that summary views return meaningful content
(not empty string) for schemes that have data at summary state.

## Todo: http/https Summary View (rummy.web)

Search results should be stored at `summary` state (snippet = summary,
fetched article = full). The rummy.web summary view (`#summaryUrl`)
expects `title`/`excerpt`/`byline` attributes from Playwright, but
search results only have `query`/`engine` attributes. The summary view
returns empty. rummy.web@0.0.10 works around this by storing search
results at `full`, which is semantically wrong.

Correct fix (in rummy.web): store search results at `summary` with
`title` and `snippet` as attributes. The summary view renders from
attributes. `<get>` promotes to `full` via Playwright fetch. This
gives the model a natural read → promote workflow for URLs.

## Todo: Test Improvements

- [ ] Unknown investigation e2e test flaky (model doesn't always register unknowns)
- [ ] Add e2e test for multi-edit sed chaining
- [ ] Add e2e test for ask mode restrictions
- [ ] Integration test for scheme registration via plugins
- [ ] E2E test diagnostic DBs persist to /tmp/rummy_test_diag/ — use for debugging
- [ ] Old test DBs cleaned at suite start, not end

## Done: Loops Table (2026-04-06)

First-class loop entity: projects > runs > loops > turns. Replaced
`prompt_queue` table. Each ask/act creates a loop. Unique partial
index enforces one running loop per run. `loop_id` FK on turns,
known_entries, turn_context. `get_latest_summary` and `has_rejections`
scoped to loop — fixes stale summary from previous loop causing
premature completion (the ask_user resolution bug).

## Done: XmlParser Mismatched Close Tag Recovery (2026-04-06)

When a known tool opens while another is still current, the old one
is closed and emitted. Fixes `<rm>...</unknown><update><search>` where
htmlparser2 nests subsequent tools inside the unclosed rm. Test added.

## Done: Plugin Loader Global Resolution (2026-04-06)

External plugins (`RUMMY_PLUGIN_*` env vars) now resolve from global
`node_modules` when not found locally. `resolvePlugin()` checks local
then global — no fallback, explicit error if neither found. Removed
rummy.web and rummy.repo from package.json dependencies.

## Done: Phantom Tool Cleanup (2026-04-06)

`ensureTool()` only called from `on("handler")`, not `on("full")`.
Plugins that register views without handlers (file plugin) no longer
appear in the model's tool list. Removes `file` from tool list.

## Done: Error Feedback on Missing Path (2026-04-06)

Get, store, and rm handlers return a labeled error entry when the
model sends them without a path. Previously silently returned,
giving the model no feedback to self-correct.

## Done: Set Docs and Error Messages (2026-04-06)

- "literal SEARCH/REPLACE blocks" in set docs
- "SEARCH blocks are matched literally, not as a pattern" error message
- rm docs example updated: `known://donald-rumsfeld-was-born-in-1932`
  (traces lifecycle from known docs, replaces stale `unknown://42`)

## Done: HTTP Status Codes (2026-04-06)

Replaced `state TEXT` with `status INTEGER` (HTTP codes) and
`fidelity TEXT` (visibility level) on known_entries. Runs and loops
also use HTTP status codes. Schemes table simplified — no valid_states,
no fidelity column.

Status codes: 200=OK, 201=Created, 202=Accepted (proposed),
301=Moved, 302=Found, 400=Bad Request, 403=Forbidden (rejected),
404=Not Found, 409=Conflict, 410=Gone, 500=Error, 499=Aborted.

The ghost in the model data — zero tokens spent teaching the model
a state machine it already knows.

External plugins (rummy.web, rummy.repo) updated locally. rummy.nvim
client migrated to integer status codes.

## Done: File Activate Promotion (2026-04-06)

File.activate now promotes existing matching entries immediately,
symmetric with how File.ignore demotes them. Previously, activating
a pattern only stored the constraint — entries weren't promoted
until the next file scan.

## Done: getEntries Fidelity Field (2026-04-06)

Server getEntries response now includes `fidelity` field. Client
uses fidelity (not status) to determine buffer visibility marking.

## Done: Previous Loop Context (2026-04-06)

- Previous/current assembly plugins use entry's own fidelity from the
  view, not hardcoded summary/full. Fidelity is the view's decision.
- Previous loop prompts (ask/act entries, category "prompt") now
  included in `<previous>`. Previously stripped, which erased the
  model's memory of what was asked in earlier loops. Root cause of
  the "lite mode" e2e failure — model couldn't recall "42" because
  the original prompt wasn't in context.

## Done: Plugin Architecture Refactor

- All 18 plugins converted: static `register(hooks)` → instantiated `constructor(core)`
- PluginContext (`rummy.core`) — plugin-only tier
- ToolRegistry: `ensureTool`, `onView`/`view` (fidelity-keyed), no `register()`
- Assembly filter chain: Known, Previous, Unknown, Current, Progress, Prompt
- ContextAssembler → 30 line orchestrator
- Tool docs → `instructions.toolDocs` filter (each plugin owns its docs.md)
- Preamble → `instructions/preamble.md` (prompt.md deleted)
- Unified API: model/client/plugin use same interface

## Done: xAI Integration

- XaiClient for Responses API (`x.ai/` prefix)
- Cached tokens, reasoning tokens, cost tracking
- `last_run.txt` telemetry dump

## Done: Hedberg Plugin

- Pattern library (hedmatch, hedsearch, hedreplace)
- Heuristic fuzzy matcher
- Sed parsing with escaped delimiters and chaining
- Edit format detection (merge conflict, udiff, Claude XML, JSON)
- Attribute normalization (value→body, unknown-attr→path)
- Full sed regex via native JS RegExp
- `Hedberg.replace()` — single entry point for all replacement operations

## Done: Packet Restructuring

```
[system]
    [instructions — preamble + toolDocs filter + persona]
    <known> — skills first, then by fidelity, then by category
    <previous> — completed loop history
    <unknowns> — unresolved questions
[/system]
[user]
    <current> — active loop work
    <progress> — token budget + unknown count + bridge text
    <ask>/<act> — always last, always present
[/user]
```

## Done: Cleanup

- `RUMMY_MODEL_DEFAULT` removed — model required on every call
- `OPENAI_API_BASE` fallback removed
- Hedberg legacy default export removed
- LlmProvider env fallback removed
- Tilde expansion removed
- Ctags dependency removed from core
- `dedup` replaces `slugPath` for file-targeting schemes
- `read` → `get` in ResponseHealer investigation tools
- File path encoding fix (no slugify on file paths)

## Deferred

- Relevance engine (stochastic, separate project/plugin)
- Hedberg extraction to `@possumtech/rummy.hedberg` npm package
- Janitor plugin (deterministic context budget management)
- Bulk operation aggregation (one entry per pattern operation)
- Non-git file scanner fallback
